# add-function
CPP functions
In the given code, object is an instance of the Addition class. The Addition class has a member function add, which is called using the object instance.




The syntax for calling a member function of a class is:

 object.function(arguments);




Here, object is an instance of the class, and function is the name of the member function being called. arguments are the parameters being passed to the function.

In the given code, object is an instance of the Addition class, and add is the name of the member function. The variables a and b are passed as arguments to the function.

Therefore, the statement cout << "Sum: " << object.add(a, b) << endl; calls the add function on the object instance, passing the variables a and b as arguments, and prints the sum returned by the function to the console.
